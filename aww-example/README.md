### Ideas
K.I.S as a spa app centered around the main feature, the restaurant finder. 
Have folderover pages with the relevant info on
 - Feed it Forward- what it is, why, and when (all relevant event info)
 - Restaurant Registration
 - Sponsor List


Things to consider: 
 - React using browser router can mimic the multi page aspect of original site
 - no longer a spa but may be what people want
